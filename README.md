# Building my new Porfolio 

&nbsp;

My priority is based on one of the principles of agile manifesto

## Working software is the primary measure of progress 
&nbsp;
### The Goal is to convert my old portfolio using React 

This is my old portfolio: [https://withluis.com/](https://withluis.com/) previous to [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/)

**Note: this portfolio is going to be built from back to front, it may not have an appealing style for a while.**
